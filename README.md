# View-Angle-Invariant-Object-Monitoring-Without-Image-Registration
Object monitoring can be performed by change detection algorithms. However, for the image pair with a large perspective difference, the change detection performance is usually impacted by inaccurate image registration. To address the above difficulties, a novel object-specific change detection approach is proposed for object monitoring in this paper. In contrast to traditional approaches, the proposed approach is robust to view angle variation and does not require explicit image registration. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach.
